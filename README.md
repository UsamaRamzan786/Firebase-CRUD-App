# FlutterFire Samples

This is a sample app demonstrating how to perform CRUD operations on **Firebase Cloud Firestore** using Flutter. We have build a simple note management app for the demonstration.

> **NOTE:** This sample app uses the latest **Flutter 2.0 stable release**, with *null safety* enabled. Make sure you are using Flutter 2 in order to prevent any build errors. Tested on Android, iOS & Web.
